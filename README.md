This is the Repo for the basics of the Maths for to start the DSA from the beginning...
# 🚀 Day 8 (Maths Basics for DSA)

Today I learned some **basic maths concepts** that are commonly used in Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Extracting Digits of a Number
- Use modulo (`% 10`) to extract the last digit.  
- Use division (`/ 10`) to remove the last digit.  
- Repeat until the number becomes 0.  

---

### 2️⃣ Counting Digits in a Number
- Continuously divide the number by 10.  
- Keep a counter for how many times division happens.  
- The counter gives the number of digits.  

---

### 3️⃣ Palindrome Check (Number)
- Reverse the number.  
- Compare the reversed number with the original.  
- If they are the same → It’s a palindrome.  

---

### 4️⃣ Reversing a Number
- Extract digits one by one from the original number.  
- Rebuild the number in reverse order.  

---

## 🕒 Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log10(n))` → depends on the number of digits.  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

## ✅ Summary
Today’s progress:  
✔ Learned digit extraction  
✔ Learned digit counting  
✔ Understood palindrome check  
✔ Learned reversing a number  

These are the building blocks for solving advanced DSA problems.
